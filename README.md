# WIND ENERGY PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
Wind energy, one of the fastest-growing sources of electricity generation, is a critical component in meeting clean energy goals. It is a sustainable and renewable power source
that can significantly reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and help mitigate the impacts of climate change. However, the inherent variability of wind speed and direction presents a significant challenge in accurately predicting the power output of wind turbines. This unpredictability can lead to inefficiencies in power grid management and energy distribution, resulting in wasted resources and missed opportunities for maximizing the use of this renewable energy source. <br/>
<br/>
To address this challenge, our project proposes the use of machine learning, specifically Supervised Learning. This branch of artificial intelligence has been increasingly used
in various fields, including renewable energy, due to its ability to learn from historical data and predict future outcomes. In wind energy, Supervised Learning algorithms
can be trained on past weather conditions and corresponding energy outputs to predict future energy production. This predictive capability can help in better planning and management of energy resources. <br/>
<br/>
The use of Multi-Dimensional Linear Regression, a type of Supervised Learning, is particularly suited for this task. This method can analyze complex interdependencies between multiple input variables, such as wind speed, wind direction, temperature, and humidity, and a single output variable, like energy output. By fitting a regression equation that minimizes forecast errors, it can select the most relevant weather forecast variables for short-term wind power forecasts. <br/>
